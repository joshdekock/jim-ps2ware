    CDXplorer does not create a CD-R which you can boot from. It just creates
    a disc that can be read once SMS is running. CDDAFS is not a method to
    launch SMS, it is a method to provide files to SMS once SMS is
    running. As far as I know there is no way to 'boot' SMS off a CD, DVD-R or
    any other removable media without a Mod-Chip. You always need either:

    from the memory card. Without an exploit or modchip there is no known way
    you can get your PS2 to run SMS. But if you find a way - let us know!

      We aren't currently attempting to compare or benchmark SMS against any

      <emphasis>What is the <quote>Independence Exploit</quote> and how does

    </phrase>

  <para lang="en">
    The <emphasis role="bold">Independence Exploit</emphasis> is a software
    based exploit that allows a PS2 to run unencrypted and homebrew applications
    (such as SMS) from the memory card.  The most concise description of what
    the exploit actually is can be found
    <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PS2_Independence_Exploit&amp;oldid=33927710">
    here</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    The Independence Exploit is one of the techniques that can be used to
    trick your PS2 into running SMS.  Normally your PS2 does not allow you
    to run unencrypted programs, and this protection is in place mainly
    to reduce the spread of copied games.  When it comes to legitimate
    open source projects like SMS, the protection only stands in the way of
    running  SMS.  When installed, the Independence Exploit allows the user to
    run  a specific application stored on the memory card.  Often the chosen
    application will be an ELF launching program (a file browser) which
    then allows further applications to be launched.  The Exploit itself
    is executed by inserting a chosen PS1 <quote>trigger disc</quote>,
    inserting a memory card with specially modified files on it, and
    then pressing reset.  Tutorial of how to get the correct specially
    modified files onto your memory card can be found
    <ulink url="http://www.exploitstation.com/index.php?page=faq">here</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    The recommended approach is to use the tutorial to install an ELF launching
    program and an FTP server.  Then you can use the FTP server to install
    as many other applications (ELF files) as you want.  It also then allows 
    you to make backups of all your saved games which is handy for those
    strange people who still use their PS2 to play games!
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    The exploit is significant to SMS users since it is one of the cheapest
    ways of running SMS, requiring no additional hardware other than a
    PS2, a memory card, and an original PS1 game.

<sect1 id="faq-dhcp">
  <title>
    <phrase lang="en">
      <emphasis>I can't access SMS on my DHCP network.  SMS won't
      autoconfigure it's IP address.  What's wrong?
      </emphasis>
    </phrase>
  </title>
  <para lang="en">
    SMS will not automatically configure it's IP address from a DHCP (Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol) server, such as the DHCP server normally
    found running in wireless access points etc.  SMS requires a static
    (or manual) IP address, set in
    <filename>mc0:/SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT</filename>, (see
    <xref linkend="installation-configuration-ipconfig"/>).
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    This does not mean that you need to disable DHCP and make your whole
    network run on static IP addresses.  All you need to do is check the
    configuration of the DHCP server, and manually set your PS2 IP address
    to be compatible.  Most DHCP servers will have a range of IP addresses
    that they will assign to DHCP clients (for example, my linksys WRT54G
    access point assigns IP addresses from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.254)
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    As long as you set your PS2 IP address outside of this range (e.g.
    192.168.1.22), then SMS will run happily alongside your DHCP clients.
    You may need to adjust your DHCP settings by changing the start IP
    address if there is not already a range you can use.
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    Of course you need to make sure that the IP address you use is not
    used by any other nodes on your network (such as PCs, other PS2s, or
    the access point itself), and the PS2 must be on the same subnet (i.e.
    the first 3 numbers of the IP address must be the same as other nodes on
    your network).
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para lang="en">
      If you are not sure whether you've got a DHCP server or not, go to
      a command prompt, and type <userinput>ipconfig /all</userinput>.  If
      you see a DHCP server listed with an IP address, then it means
      you <emphasis role="bold">have</emphasis> got a DHCP server running.
      You can usually access the configuration settings of access points
      by typing the access point IP address into a web browser.

      <emphasis>Does the PS2 optical digital output work in SMS for AC3 
      passthrough?</emphasis>
    </phrase>
  </title>
  <para lang="en">
    No.  The PS2 optical digital output is not currently supported by SMS.
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    The optical digital output would allow the PS2 output to be connected
    via a fibre optic cable to an external audio processor such as a dolby
    digital home cinema system.  However, this is not yet supported, and you
    are advised to use the standard audio outputs in the mean time.
  </para>

    This feature may be introduced in a future release of SMS.  Anyone who
    would like to (and has the necessary hardware) is welcome to develop it.
